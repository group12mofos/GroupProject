<h2><u>Very fast Git Tutorial</u></h2>
<br>
<b>What is Git?</b><br>
Git is a form of version control for use in project development. Its designed with speed, accuracy and simplicity in mind.
In order to use git, you need a git client. For us, I recommend GitBash (<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>).
While there is a GitBash GUI version, I detest it and find it easier to use the CLI version which is what I'll be writing about.

<b>Cloning the Repository</b>
<br>
If you're viewing this, it means you've found our repo. Well done. However, unless you want to sit and copy pasta everything for hours to get the latest version,
you're gonna have to use git to access our files. Basically, your first step with git is going to be to 'clone' the repository. This downloads our
repository as well as the files necessary for git to run. For example, to clone our repository:
<br><br>
$ git clone git://github.com/group12mofos/groupProject
<br><br>
Note the 'git' scheme.

<b>Adding a New File to the Repository</b><br>
Having a file in the same folder as our repository does not mean that it is part of it. Instead, we have to add it to our file index.
Every time that file is changed, it needs to be added to the index. Once you're happy with a file, you need to commit it as well. Once this is done, the file is ready to be pushed to our online repository.
For example, adding a file called 'HelloWorld.html' which is located in the same directory and committing it would be:
<br><br>
$ git add HelloWorld.html<br>
$ git commit -m "Added HelloWorld page"
<br><br>
Note the '-m' tag. This is the message you add to the changelog for that file(s).

<b>Pushing your Version to the Remote Repository</b>
<br>
Once you've added files and committed changes, you'll want to send your version to the remote repository. This is easily done using the 'push' command. For example:
<br><br>
$ git push https://github.com/group12mofos/groupProject
<br><br>
Note the 'https' scheme. The system will ask you for the username and password, enter them and it should begin the upload.
